# ng-babylon

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and is designed as a basic template for [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) combined with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) in Version 4.0

The project is setup to use global [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) only and [ViewEncapsulation.None](https://angular.io/api/core/ViewEncapsulation).

Feel free to do anything you want with this template.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
